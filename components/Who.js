        “God in your Garden is for anyone wanting to enjoy a raw, real-time,
        organic, and dynamic relationship with God. It is rooted in Christian
        truth, but it is not just for Christian readers. God desires to live our
        lives together with us right where we are, and Jesus makes that
        opportunity available for ALL of us—students and teachers, professionals
        and administrators, labor and management, singles and married, young and
        retired—anyone desiring an intimate and hands-on life together with
        God.” — Scott Hull
